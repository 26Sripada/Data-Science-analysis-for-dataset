# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra

# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

#to read the file
